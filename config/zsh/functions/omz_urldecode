# URL-decode a string
#
# Decodes a RFC 2396 URL-encoded (%-escaped) string.
# This decodes the '+' and '%' escapes in the input string, and leaves
# other characters unchanged. Does not enforce that the input is a
# valid URL-encoded string. This is a convenience to allow callers to
# pass in a full URL or similar strings and decode them for human
# presentation.
#
# Outputs the encoded string on stdout.
# Returns nonzero if encoding failed.
#
# Usage:
#   omz_urldecode <urlstring>  - prints decoded string followed by a newline
function omz_urldecode {
  emulate -L zsh
  local encoded_url=$1

  # Work bytewise, since URLs escape UTF-8 octets
  local caller_encoding=$langinfo[CODESET]
  local LC_ALL=C
  export LC_ALL

  # Change + back to ' '
  local tmp=${encoded_url:gs/+/ /}
  # Protect other escapes to pass through the printf unchanged
  tmp=${tmp:gs/\\/\\\\/}
  # Handle %-escapes by turning them into `\xXX` printf escapes
  tmp=${tmp:gs/%/\\x/}
  local decoded="$(printf -- "$tmp")"

  # Now we have a UTF-8 encoded string in the variable. We need to re-encode
  # it if caller is in a non-UTF-8 locale.

  safe_encodings=(UTF-8 utf8 US-ASCII)

    decoded=$(echo -E "$decoded" | iconv -f UTF-8 -t $caller_encoding)

      echo "Error converting string from UTF-8 to $caller_encoding" >&2
