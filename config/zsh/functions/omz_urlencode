# URL-encode a string
#
# Encodes a string using RFC 2396 URL-encoding (%-escaped).
# See: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt
#
# By default, reserved characters and unreserved "mark" characters are
# not escaped by this function. This allows the common usage of passing
# an entire URL in, and encoding just special characters in it, with
# the expectation that reserved and mark characters are used appropriately.
# The -r and -m options turn on escaping of the reserved and mark characters,
# respectively, which allows arbitrary strings to be fully escaped for
# embedding inside URLs, where reserved characters might be misinterpreted.
#
# Prints the encoded string on stdout.
# Returns nonzero if encoding failed.
#
# Usage:
#  omz_urlencode [-r] [-m] [-P] <string> [<string> ...]
#
#    -r causes reserved characters (;/?:@&=+$,) to be escaped
#
#    -m causes "mark" characters (_.!~*''()-) to be escaped
#
#    -P causes spaces to be encoded as '%20' instead of '+'
