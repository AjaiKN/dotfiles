#+title: Ajai's Doom Modules

* Description
This directory contains my custom Doom Emacs modules. Some are forked from Doom's existing official modules, and others were develeoped from scratch. Some are meant to replace Doom's modules, some extend the functionality of existing Doom modules, and some provide new functionality. See the module descriptions below for more details.

The modules vary greatly in their levels maturity and reliability. In the list below, I've tried to mark which ones are more and less reliable.
* Installation
Doom v3, which hasn't been released yet, will include a convenient way to install third-party modules like these ones. In the meantime, if you want to use my modules, you'll have to copy or symlink my modules into your modules directory:

1. Copy my modules (either the whole directory, or just the ones you want) into your modules directory:
   #+begin_src bash
   # Your Doom configuration is probably in one of these locations. Choose the correct one:
   DOOMDIR="$HOME/.doom.d"
   DOOMDIR="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/doom

   # Make sure you're in this directory (my modules/ directory).
   # Then you can symlink my entire modules directory to your modules directory:
   ln -s "$(realpath .)" "$DOOMDIR"/

   # OR, you can symlink individual modules:
   mkdir -p "$DOOMDIR"/modules/{app,completion,config,editor,emacs,input,lang,os,term,tools,ui}
   ln -s "$(realpath ./editor/words)" "$DOOMDIR"/modules/editor/
   ln -s "$(realpath ./completion/fuzzy)" "$DOOMDIR"/modules/completion/
   #+end_src

2. Most of my modules have an implicit dependency on my utilities library, [[https://github.com/AjaiKN/dotfiles/blob/main/config/doom/lisp/akn/akn.el][akn.el]].
   There are multiple ways to install it.

   The simplest one is probably to add the following to your ~$DOOMDIR/packages.el~:
   #+begin_src elisp
   (package! akn
     :recipe (:host github :repo "AjaiKN/dotfiles" :files ("config/doom/lisp/akn/*.el") :nonrecursive t))
   #+end_src

   Or if you have the [[https://github.com/AjaiKN/dotfiles/tree/main/config/doom/lisp/akn][akn directory]] on your machine, you can add the following instead:

    #+begin_src elisp
   (package! akn
     :recipe (:local-repo "/path/to/akn"))
   #+end_src

   Or you can download [[https://github.com/AjaiKN/dotfiles/blob/main/config/doom/lisp/akn/akn.el][akn.el]], then add the following line to your ~$DOOMDIR/init.el~:
   #+begin_src elisp
   (load! "/path/to/akn.el")
   #+end_src

3. Enable the modules you want in your ~$DOOMDIR/init.el~.

4. Sync Doom configuration:
   #+begin_src bash
   doom sync
   #+end_src

* Module list
** :app
*** [[./app/everywhere][everywhere]]: adds system-wide popup Emacs windows for quick edits
Similar to Doom's built-in ~:app everywhere~ module, except:
- I made some tweaks to make it work better on my machine
- adds support for [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]], which works better for me in the browser (including in Firefox, despite the name)
*** 🕰 [[./app/github-explorer][github-explorer]]: view GitHub repositories in Emacs without cloning them
*** 🚧 [[./app/omni][omni]]: support for [[https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-omni][consult-omni]]
*** 🕰 [[./app/transcribe][transcribe]]: utilities for making transcriptions synced with videos

** :completion
*** ⭐ [[./completion/fuzzy][fuzzy]]: fuzzy completion using [[https://github.com/jojojames/fussy][fussy]]

To actually use this module, you'll need to add it to ~completion-styles~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; NOTE: don't remove the basic style, or else Tramp host name completion won't work!
;; Use fuzzy completion
(setq completion-styles '(fussy basic))
;; OR, use it as a backup if orderless returns nothing (this is my preference)
(setq completion-styles '(orderless fussy basic))
#+end_src

This module supports all the completion packages supported by [[https://github.com/jojojames/fussy][fussy]]:
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +flx][+flx]] (default)
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +flx-rs][+flx-rs]]
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +fzf-native][+fzf-native]]
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +fuz-bin][+fuz-bin]]
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +fuz][+fuz]]
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +liquidmetal][+liquidmetal]]
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +sublime-fuzzy][+sublime-fuzzy]]
- [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +hotfuzz][+hotfuzz]]
To /install/ all of these packages (e.g., to make it easier to try out the different packages), use [[doom-module::completion fuzzy +all][+all]]. (To choose which one will actually be /used/, add one of the flags above.)
*** ⭐🐁 [[./completion/hippie][hippie]]: support for the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/autotype/Hippie-Expand.html][hippie-expand]]
*** 🚧🐁 [[./completion/p-search][p-search]]: support for [[https://github.com/zkry/p-search][p-search]]
*** ⭐ [[./completion/preview][preview]]: support for the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Symbol-Completion.html][completion-preview-mode]]
** :config
*** ⭐🏢 [[./config/akn-bindings][akn-bindings]]: my preferred keybindings (put this after Doom's [[doom-module::config default +bindings][:config default +bindings]])
Flags:
**** +leader-keys: set my preferred leader and localleader keys
**** +leader-bindings: use my preferred bindings under the leader keys
**** +evil-insert: use my preferred bindings in evil insert state
** :editor
*** ⭐🏢 [[./editor/fold][fold]]: marries [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hideshow.html][hideshow]], [[https://github.com/mrkkrp/vimish-fold][vimish-fold]], [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold][ts-fold]], [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/treesit-fold][treesit-fold]], [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/comint-fold][comint-fold]], and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Outline-Minor-Mode.html][outline-minor-mode]] (enhanced with [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/outli][outli]] and [[https://github.com/jamescherti/outline-indent.el][outline-indent]]) to bring you marker-, indent- and syntax-based code folding for as many languages as possible.
Similar to Doom's built-in ~:editor fold~ module, except:
- adds support for more packages with more kinds of folds
- for evil users, adds ~<tab>~ and ~S-<tab>~ bindings in normal state
*** 🕰 [[./editor/license-headers][license-headers]]: inserting licenses and license headers
*** 🕰 [[./editor/mindstream][mindstream]]: see [[https://github.com/countvajhula/mindstream][the mindstream package]]
*** ⭐🏢 [[./editor/multiple-cursors][multiple-cursors]]:
Forked from Doom's ~:editor multiple-cursors~.
- I make an ambitious attempt to combine ~evil-mc~ with ~multiple-cursors~.
  I think ~multiple-cursors~ is generally better, except it doesn't work well with evil.
  So this module automatically switches to ~multiple-cursors~ when in insert/emacs state and ~evil-mc~ in all other evil states.
- Added some extra commands and keybindings (e.g., for making a cursor below, and for super-clicking somewhere to create a cursor there)
*** 🕰 [[./editor/smart-tabs][smart-tabs]]: see [[https://github.com/jcsalomon/smarttabs][the smart-tabs-mode package]] (tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment)
*** 🕰 [[./editor/symex][symex]]: the evilest way to lisp, and the modalest way to evil

*** ⭐ [[./emacs/electric-operator][electric-operator]]: automatically insert spaces around operators in many different programming languages (e.g., typing "3+3" produces "3 + 3")
*** 🕰 [[./emacs/elmacro][elmacro]]: convert keyboard macros into Emacs Lisp functions
*** ⭐🐁 [[./emacs/keyfreq][keyfreq]]: measure how often you use different commands, to help you optimize your keybindings

*** [[./emacs/secondary-selection][secondary-selection]]: make use of Emacs's obscure [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Secondary-Selection.html]["secondary selection" feature]]
*** ⭐🏢 [[./emacs/vlf][vlf]]: view large files without loading the whole thing into memory
** :input
*** 🕰 [[./input/csi-u][csi-u]]: support for [[https://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/][CSI u]], which is used by [[https://iterm2.com/documentation-csiu.html][iTerm2]] to send lots of extra keys that terminal emulators don't normally send

NOTE: On terminal emulators that support the [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/][Kitty Keyboard Protocol (KKP)]], like Kitty and WezTerm, this module isn't needed, since Doom now supports KKP by default if ~:os tty~ is enabled.
